Making JavaScript accessible to everyone with a JavaScript framework that teaches the basics of what you can do with JavaScript.

This framework's main features are:

## Configuration
1. download getstarted.js and _locales/en.js
2. if you want to use a locale other than english download them too
3. insert script tags for all downloaded files in HTML page
       <script type="text/javascript" src="_locales/en.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="getstarted.js"></script>
4. define locale in `<html lang="` **locale** `">` or programmatically with `_getstarted.set_locale(` **locale** `)`
